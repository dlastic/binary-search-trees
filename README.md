# Binary Search Trees

This project implements a balanced binary search tree (BST) in JavaScript, supporting insertion, deletion, search, and multiple tree traversal methods (level-order, pre-order, in-order, post-order). It includes utility functions to measure node height and depth, check tree balance, and rebalance as needed.

The driver script demonstrates creating a BST from random data, verifying its balance, performing traversals with inline output, unbalancing the tree by inserting larger values, and rebalancing it to restore optimal structure.
